## Hello!

My name is Gabriel Brito, I'm a programmer and civil engineer, and I'm looking for knowledge.
Here you'll find some of my projects and ideas, developed in courses and personal studies.

I like to learn about everything, watch soccer, finding solutions and I have a special care for music and my family.

Currently, I'm focusing in Front-end and Back-end web development, by studying and increasing my skills, looking for an opportunity to contribute in a nice work-flow environment.

If you wanna get in touch, here are some ways you can find me:
